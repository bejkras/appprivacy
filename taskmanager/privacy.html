<strong>Summary:</strong> This app works entirely offline. We do not collect, store, share, or transmit any personal data.
</div>

<h2>1. Overview</h2>
<p>
This Privacy Policy explains how this app (“we”, “our”, or “the app”) handles information when you download and use it.
The app is a one-time paid download and does not contain advertisements or in-app tracking.
</p>

<h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>

  <li>No analytics or tracking</li>
  <li>No advertising identifiers</li>
  <li>No network requests or server communication</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Offline Data Storage</h2>
<p>
All data you create in the app (such as tasks, habits, notes, or expenses) is stored locally on your device only.
This data never leaves your device and is not backed up to any external server by us.
</p>

<h2>4. Payments</h2>

The app is purchased as a one-time download through the Apple App Store.
We do not process payments directly and do not receive your payment information.
All payments are handled securely by Apple.

<p>
The app does not use any third-party SDKs, analytics services, advertising platforms, or external APIs.
</p>

<h2>6. Children’s Privacy</h2>
<p>
The app is suitable for all users, including children. Since no personal data is collected,
there is no risk of collecting children’s personal information.
</p>

<h2>7. Data Security</h2>
<p>
Because all data remains on your device, you have full control over it.
Protecting your device with a passcode or biometric security helps keep your data secure.
</p>

<h2>8. Data Deletion</h2>

You may delete all app data at any time by deleting the app from your device.
