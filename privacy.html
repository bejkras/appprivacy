  <section class="note">
    <strong>Summary:</strong> MathQuestAMT is a quiz app supported by mobile advertising (Google AdMob). We do not require account registration.
    Some device information may be collected automatically by advertising partners to show ads, measure performance, and prevent fraud.
  </section>

  <h2>1) Who We Are</h2>
  <p>
    This Privacy Policy explains how MathQuestAMT (“we”, “our”, or “the app”) handles information when you use the app.
  </p>

  <h2>2) Information We Collect</h2>
  <p><strong>A) Information you provide</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>No account required:</strong> We do not require you to create an account.</li>
    <li><strong>No direct personal data submission:</strong> The app does not ask you to provide your name, email, or phone number.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>B) Information collected automatically (Advertising)</strong></p>
  <p>
    The app displays ads using <strong>Google AdMob</strong>. AdMob and its partners may automatically collect certain information from your device,
    depending on your device settings and consent choices (for example, in regions that require consent).
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Device Identifiers</strong> (e.g., Advertising Identifier/IDFA or other device IDs)</li>
    <li><strong>Approximate location</strong> (derived from IP address)</li>
    <li><strong>Usage data</strong> (e.g., app interactions, ad performance, crash/diagnostic data)</li>
    <li><strong>Advertising data</strong> (e.g., which ads were shown, clicks, frequency caps)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3) How We Use Information</h2>
  <p>Advertising-related data may be used to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Display ads (including personalized ads when permitted and with appropriate consent)</li>
    <li>Measure ad performance and analytics</li>
    <li>Limit how often you see the same ad (frequency capping)</li>
    <li>Detect and prevent fraud, abuse, and security incidents</li>
    <li>Improve app stability (diagnostics)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4) App Tracking Transparency (IDFA)</h2>
  <p>
    On iOS, we may request permission using Apple’s <strong>App Tracking Transparency</strong> prompt.
    If you allow tracking, AdMob may access the device’s advertising identifier (IDFA) to deliver more relevant ads and measure results.
    If you do not allow tracking, ads may still be shown but may be less personalized.
  </p>

  <h2>5) Sharing of Information</h2>
  <p>
    We do not sell your personal information. However, we may share limited device and usage information with:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Google AdMob</strong> (Google LLC) and its ad partners to serve and measure ads</li>
    <li><strong>Service providers</strong> supporting app operation (only as needed, and under confidentiality obligations)</li>
    <li><strong>Legal authorities</strong> if required by law or to protect rights, safety, and security</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6) Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>
    Ads in MathQuestAMT are provided by third-party services such as Google AdMob. Their data practices are governed by their own policies.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Google Privacy Policy: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">policies.google.com/privacy</a></li>
    <li>Google AdMob: <a href="https://support.google.com/admob/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">support.google.com/admob</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>7) Children’s Privacy (Age Rating 9+)</h2>
  <p>
    MathQuestAMT is intended for general audiences with an App Store age rating of <strong>9+</strong>.
    We do not knowingly collect personal information directly from children. However, advertising partners may collect device identifiers
    and similar data for ad delivery, fraud prevention, and measurement.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you are a parent/guardian and believe a child has provided personal information to us directly, please contact us and we will take appropriate steps.
  </p>

  <h2>8) Your Choices</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Tracking permission (iOS):</strong> You can allow or deny tracking when prompted, and change it later in iOS Settings.</li>
    <li><strong>Personalized ads:</strong> Depending on your region, you may see a consent option for personalized vs. non-personalized ads.</li>
    <li><strong>Limit ad personalization (Google):</strong> You may manage ad settings in your Google account if applicable.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>9) Data Retention</h2>
  <p>
    We do not store personal accounts or profiles. Advertising and diagnostic data may be retained by Google and partners according to their retention policies.
  </p>

  <h2>10) Security</h2>
  <p>
    We take reasonable measures to protect information processed through the app. No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.
  </p>

  <h2>11) International Users</h2>
  <p>
    If you use the app from outside your country, information may be processed by third-party providers in other jurisdictions (e.g., Google).
  </p>

  <h2>12) Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Updates will be posted on this page with a revised effective date.
